# DC3Land Crypto Game
Crypto Game in old fashioned Zelda style to interact with Smart Contracts and save data in IPFS

## Requirements
- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Basic understanding of Tokens and NFTs
- Crypto Wallet (game optimized for Metamask)
- Moralis.io account
## Tools
- Code Editor (I've used Visual Studio Code)
- Remix or any framework to deploy on Polygon Network
## Scope
- I create this game to show interaction between a game and smart contracts, for demo purpose only
## Notes
- It works just on PC browsers
- I took inspiration by two videos 
	- Build Your Own Web 3.0 Metaverse using Solidity, Javascript and Moralis by Daniel Itzul from Moralis.io
